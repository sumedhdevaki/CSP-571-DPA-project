## Abstract
In this project, a ML pipeline with the help of Scikit-Learn was built and a classification model has been trained on given dataset in CSV format. The pipeline involved data preprocessing that involved missing value handling, scaling of features, as well as addressing the problem of class imbalance through SMOTE. The model was trained using Random Forest classifier algorithm, and the following performance evaluation metrics; accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were applied. After training the model using the described approach, the generated model is converted to ONNX format for efficient working in different deployment platforms of edge inference. This model performance of the index was fairly accurate for future predictions and there is potential for fine-tuning of the index for better predictor accuracy. This work offers a good starting foundation for deploying an ML model on an edge node using ONNX for interoperability.
